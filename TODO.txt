- Try retinaface on autistic dataset testing and record results
    - Consider retraining source with austistic dataset if not acceptable
- Get pip retinaface working with camera frame inputs
    - Draw detection box onto the screen
        - For the first 5 seconds, grab center-most face
        - After 5s, get the face with closest distance to last frame
    - Show just the cropped face

CDR content
Get the face recognizer running on the camera feed
Crop the faces into separate images and display those
Run the emotion recognition on each of those
If thereâ€™s a way to check which face is the same mathematically, do that. Otherwise, get the closest face to the last frame bounds
Implement reset function that grabs the new central face every frame the next 2s then locks on that one
