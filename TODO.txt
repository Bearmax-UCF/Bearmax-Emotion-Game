    - Tutorial to enable SPI on Jetson
- Need to then try the device driver for this camera which might not work on anything other than the PICO


Non--camera stuff tow ork on: write python code to take an image (same format as CV2 will provide - look for code snippet to figure out what format, use a stub for now to pull image from local) and run it on a face detection model
- Can the model track some identifier on the face or do we need to use bounding box tracking?
- When we have the face, use CV2 to cut into a smaller image of just the face for emotion model to run on after


Python: 3.6.9


Install all dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
